Many terminals suffer from display bugs for certain glyphs, making them
spill over to neighbouring cells -- usually to the right but going up or
down also happens.  Even worse, this spillage depends heavily on the order
characters are written to the screen, cursor jumps and attribute changes.

This character map tool helps you find characters that display ok on your
terminal, trying to trigger as many bugs as possible.  Ie, if a given
character is not clipped, it should probably be safe to use.  For you.
Other setups might display different problems, but that can't be helped.

Usage:
Compile (no dependencies needed -- not even curses), run with no args.

Keys:
PgUp/PgDn to navigate, F1-F4 jumps to few spots, q exits.
